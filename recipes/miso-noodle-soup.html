    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Our version of miso noodle soup in a jar was inspired by recipes on TikTok for miso soup in a jar. Try this heat-and-eat recipe for a warming main to prep and tote all season long. Use jars labeled “microwave-safe” (check the bottoms) and never microwave the lids.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces extra-firm tofu</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sliced green onions</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white miso paste</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable stock base</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups cooked rice vermicelli noodles</li> 
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced shiitake mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced baby bok choy</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Cut tofu into 1/2-inch planks. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tofu, turning halfway through, until golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Cut tofu into cubes.</li>
        <li>Stir together green onions, miso paste, garlic, stock base, and ginger in a small bowl. Divide evenly among 3 microwave-safe pint-size canning jars with lids.</li>
        <li>Layer evenly with rice vermicelli noodles, tofu, mushrooms, and bok choy. Chill, covered, up to 5 days. To serve, see “Heat and Eat”. Garnish with sliced green onions.</li>
        </ol>
